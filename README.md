# REACT Racing-Game

Game created with REACT library, webpack and sass.

The idea was to create simple but fun 8/16-bit styled game with REACT as a final project after Coders Lab course. The REACT library was the last week of the course.

Title screen reminds the good old games from the past. Just click to start the game.

The Game

the point of the game is to change gears using spacebar in the fastest possible way. The tachometer changes color from yellow (prepare) to green (ready! Change gear) to red (overrev). The enemy changes gear too so player won't win with only one gear change.

Game ends when player's car reaches the end of screen. Right now there is no text who won - it will be added later.
